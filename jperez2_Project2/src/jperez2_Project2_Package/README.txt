Section 1: 

This time, much like last time, the code was run in Eclipse and performed all of the functionality fine. In order to run the code, the grader must load the submitted file into Eclipse (if possible) and run as a Java Application. At that point, the user will be prompted with the corresponding prompts and may begin typing commands. Just like last project, I was unable to get the project working through command line unfortunately. In addition, the Project2Dataset was put alongside "bin" and "src" in order to obtain the functionality explained.

Section 2:

At the current moment, all parts of the project are functioning. However, I have not tried to break the program in order to determine edge cases. 

Section 3:

I tried to adhere as close as possible as I could to the project description, only making classes as I saw relevance to the document on canvas. I tried not to develop any classes or structures that were beyond the project description... however, I did think of several approaches that could have been used organizationally which would have severely increased complexity of the project structure. I also thought of adding interfaces in order to clean up code and try to incorporate cleaner coding practices. Despite those tweaks, I tried to keep the code as simple as possible, shooting for functionality mainly.
